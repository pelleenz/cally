# Idea

The Basic Idea is to connect Cally with your Caldav Synchronized Calendar and Task
and let Cally automatically block time in your Calendar for the specified Tasks.

Communication with Cally via Syntax in Tasks / Events
(e.g.: {1800-2200} to only block time between 18:00 and 22:00 for this Task)
Recursive functionality will be done over Caldav

Cally should be able to alter Events based on other Events
(e.g. Every Workday between 06:30-17:30 plan a Work Event if no Event on that Day with Title Vacation exists)

# Syntax - Functionalities

- Between Time
- specific Weekdays only
- Duration
- How many times a Week / Month / Year
- preferences for Weekday / Time
- Filler Tasks (Hobbys)
- Projects (longer Projects which takes several Events with min. and max. Duration Time)

# Global Config

- Time field in which to plan Tasks (e.g. not at night etc.)
- Caldav Server Address / Auth Information
- included Calendars
